# Breath-Analyser


What is a breathalyzer you may ask? 


It is a device for estimating blood alcohol content (BAC) from a breath sample.In simple terms it is a device to test weather a person is drunk or not. As the title suggests it runs on the arduino.

Our breathalyzer uses the MQ-3 alcohol sensor from sparkfun.It is a simple and fun to do project.

This Breathalyzer is not meant to be used as a means of breathalyzing. 
The MQ-3 is not accurate enough to register exact BAC and is sensitive to temperature and humidity.

_**Never drink and drive and if you do call me =D .**_

<!-- **Something from chemical POV**



When the user exhales into a breath analyzer, any ethanol present in their breath is oxidized to acetic acid at the anode:



CH3CH2OH(g) + H2O(l) → CH3CO2H(l) + 4H+(aq) + 4e-



At the cathode, atmospheric oxygen is reduced:



O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e- → 2H2O(l)



The overall reaction is the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid and water.



CH3CH2OH(l) + O2(g) → CH3COOH(l) + H2O(l)



The electrical current produced by this reaction is measured by a microprocessor, and displayed as an approximation of overall blood alcohol content (BAC) by the Alcosensor.

_It is simple project and cool way to learn and represent the working of MQ3 sensor._


For more info do google about this project. I will just show you yinkercad circuit of thus project. Exact making of the breath analyser requires more harware than this. I request you to refer other webistes for more examples.




Here is the circuit on tinkercad.

Here are some other situations. Note that as the smoke comes near the sensor leds start to glow.

Finally a circuit which will make things more clear for you.
